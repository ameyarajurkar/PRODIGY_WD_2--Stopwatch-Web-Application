Prodigy InfoTech Internship – Web Development Task 02
A high-precision, Neon-Glassmorphism Stopwatch web application built during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. This project focuses on JavaScript state management, accurate timing intervals, and modern UI/UX principles.

✨ Key Features
⏱️ Precision Timing Engine
Logic vs. Display: Calculated using Date.now() to ensure 100% accuracy, preventing time-drift common with simple counters.
Monospaced Stability: Uses Share Tech Mono to ensure numerical stability, eliminating "shaking text" during time increments.
💎 Neon Glassmorphism UIAesthetic: Features a frosted-glass container with backdrop-filter: blur(15px).
Interactive Hover: Buttons utilize cubic-bezier transitions for a tactile "pop" and neon glow feedback.
📝 Dynamic Lap TrackingReal-time Logging: Record intervals without interrupting the main timer.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Markup                  HTML5 (Semantic)
Styling                 CSS3 (Glassmorphism, Flexbox, Keyframes)
